#problem statement
given house to rent data will use it to predict whether a house to be rented is furnished or not.
#how to solve
we will use supervised algorithms such as knn,ranger and ogistic regression.
#load the dataset to the workspace
```{r}
houseData<-read.csv("houses_to_rent.csv",stringsAsFactors = F,header = T)
head(houseData)
```
#load the libraries needed for data manipulation
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```
#check the shape of the data
```{r}
dim(houseData)
```
#our data has 6080 rows and 14 columns
```{r}
#check the structure

str(houseData)
```

#try to change the hoa colname
```{r}
colnames(houseData)[which(names(houseData)=="hoa")]<-"Homeowner_association_tax"
str(houseData)
```

#lets drop the first col
```{r}
houseData<-houseData[,-1]
str(houseData)
```
#dropped succesifully
#for city it is the city where the property is located
#learn more with an histogram
```{r}
hist(houseData$city)
```
#from the above there are two levels 0 and 1
#so city should be a factor variable
```{r}
houseData$city<-as.factor(houseData$city)

# true as said

#from the above plot it seems the kind of houses that exist for rent,their area is between 10 to 200
#also we might have outliers in the above two houses are very extreme
#check area again
